Figure 1: A one dimensional scoring spectrum that shows four points along a line. The points are ordered from left to right, 4, 2, 3, and 1. Points 4 and 2 appear white and points 3 and 1 appear green.
Figure 2: A density plot graphing density of GradesUndergrad values for intersectional classes. The plot shows that white female students are most likely to have a GradesUndergrad value of 1, followed by white male students, Black female students, and Black male students. All students are roughly equally likely to have a GradesUndergrad value of 0.
Figure 3: A density plot graphing density of classifier scores for intersectional classes for the baseline feature set. The plot shows that white male students are most likely to have a score of 1, followed closely by white female students, then Black female students, then Black male students.  White female students are most likely to have a score of 0, followed closely by white male students, then Black male students, then followed closely by Black female students.
Figure 4: A density plot graphing density of classifier scores for intersectional classes for the targeted feature set. The plot shows that white female students are most likely to have a score of 1, followed closely by white male students, then Black female students, then Black male students.  White female students are most likely to have a score of 0, followed closely by white male students, then Black male students, then followed closely by Black female students.
Figure 5: A density plot graphing density of stability scores for intersectional classes for the targeted feature set. The plot shows that white female students are most likely to have a stability score of 1, followed by Black female students, then white male students, then Black male students. There are additional bumps in the graph showing stability scores around 0.6 for Black male students and around 0.8 for Black female students.
Figure 6: A density plot graphing density of classifier scores for intersectional classes for the holistic feature set. The plot shows that white female students are most likely to have a score of 1, followed closely by white male students, then Black female students followed closely by Black male students. White male students are most likely to have a score of 0, followed closely by white female students, then Black female students followed closely by Black male students.
Figure 7: A density plot graphing density of stability scores for intersectional classes for the holistic feature set. There is no line for Black male students which means there is no distribution in stability for that group. Upon examination all white students had stability score 1. The graph also shows white male students, white female students, and Black female students mostly having stability score 1, although there must be some distribution in order for the plot to show.
Figure 8: A correlation plot across many varied fairness metrics and stability. The plot shows no strong correlation between stability and any existing metrics.
Figure 9: Two separate density plots graphing density of GradesUndergrad values. One plot is for male and female students and shows that female students are more likely than male students to have a GradesUndergrad value of 1. Both male and female students are roughly equally likely to have a GradesUndergrad value of 0. The second plot is for Black and white students and shows that white students are more likely than Black students to have a GradesUndergrad value of 1. Both Black and white students are roughly equally likely to have a GradesUndergrad value of 0.
Figure 10: Two separate density plots graphing density of classifier scores for the baseline feature set. One plot is for male and female students and shows both male and female students are roughly equally likely to have a score of 1, and of 0. The second plot is for Black and white students and shows that white students are more likely than Black students to have a score of 1. White students are also more likely than Black students to have a score of 0.
Figure 11: Two separate density plots graphing density of classifier scores for the targeted feature set. One plot is for male and female students and shows both male and female students are roughly equally likely to have a score of 1, and of 0. The second plot is for Black and white students and shows that white students are more likely than Black students to have a score of 1. White students are also more likely to have a score of 0.
Figure 12: Two separate density plots graphing density of stability scores for the targeted feature set. One plot is for male and female students and shows female students are more likely than male students to have a stability score closer to 1. The second plot is for Black and white students and shows that white students are more likely than Black students to have a stability score of 1. There is additionally two bumps in the plot showing stability scores among Black students around 0.6 and 0.8.
Figure 13: Two separate density plots graphing density of classifier scores for the holistic feature set. One plot is for male and female students and shows both male and female students are roughly equally likely to have a score of 1, and of 0. The second plot is for Black and white students and shows that white students are more likely than Black students to have a score of 1. White students are also more likely to have a score of 0.
